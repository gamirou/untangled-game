Maps are split up into chunks of (TOBEDECIDED)x(TOBEDECIDED) size.
The map JSON has to list all of the chunks and their position.
For example:

[
	{
		'path':'assets/maps/map_chunk_A',
		'chunkpos':{
			'x':'0',
			'y':'0'
		}
	}
	{
		'path':'assets/maps/map_chunk_B',
		'chunkpos':{
			'x':'1',
			'y':'0'
		}
	}
	{
		'path':'assets/maps/map_chunk_C',
		'chunkpos':{
			'x':'2',
			'y':'0'
		}
	}
]

Would have three chunks, all on chunk Y 0 and in a line along X
